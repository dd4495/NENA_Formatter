## Synopsis

Creates a file that contains 911 location information in the [NENA 2.1 format](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nena.org/resource/resmgr/Standards/NENA_02-010_v9_Data_Formats_.pdf) in preparation for uploading the file to a central database.

## Motivation

The previous process used to update the 911 entries was long and convoluted. This program simplified the process down to one step.

## Installation

Open the solution, build it, and run the executable.
